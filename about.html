        <h1>We love weddings! We feel they are an adventure to be experienced and captured in the form of timeless memories! Weddingbliss was born out of <br> passion to document love stories by swapnil mudrale , Weddingbliss is known for capturing REAL authentic moments in the most natural manner! <br> The team’s passion and undying enthusiasm has helped Weddingbliss carve a niche in the Indian wedding Industry. Our company specializes <br> in both wedding photography and filming with an artistic & personal touch. With our in-house dynamic team of skilled photographers, <br> cinematographers and editors, we strike a perfect balance between stunning contemporary portraiture and photojournalistic storytelling. <br> <br>

            We have a detail oriented approach and since we limit the number of weddings we take up, we are able to give enough time to each wedding for <br> post-production. The team shoots in a manner that is unobtrusive and encapsulates moments, details, emotions (that you might have not witnessed <br> in the general chaos) beautifully! Our talented editors then combine these visuals with voice-overs (if any) with the perfect background music to <br> weave your story! <br> <br>
            
            We bring out the character and essence of the celebrations and ceremonies in all its glory, tailoring our techniques to highlight the couple’s <br> personalities and chemistry. Something that speaks volumes about you. Something that is all you! There is a great deal of customization that goes <br> with attention to every minute detail, right from the way the photographs are processed to the selection of soundtracks that strike the right chords <br> to the film edit that amplifies the narrative of the story. A story that will make your hearts fuller. One you can watch over and over again to <br> reminisce about these very moments. We put our heart into collecting your special moments and preserving them for years to come, a return ticket <br> to your memories! We strongly believe that every story is unique and it needs to be captured differently. <br>  <br>  <hr>******************</h1>
